Source material:
The game is based off of the original Greek mythology story of Theseus and the Minotaur.
The bulk of the riddles came from the chapter "Riddles in the Dark" in JRR Tolkein's "The Hobbit". The spider riddle is from JK Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire". The first riddle in the game is a quote from the movie "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring".

Easter eggs:
There are a few fun surprises in my game. For one of them, if you do something you're warned against, the game will terminate automatically without you winning or losing. There is also a secret answer that will open any room.

HINT:
There are some items are necessary to pick up in order to finish the game. You cannot move backwards in the labyrinth, only forwards and only when you have completed the necessary tasks.

Caesar:
	For this program, in order to run it, two arguments must be stated in the command line. The first argument is the message to be ciphered or coded, and if it is more than one word, it should have quotation marks around it.  The second argument, separated by a space, is the key or number that the letters are to be shifted by.  

Vigenere:
	This program also requires two arguments.  The first one is the message.  This time, though, the second argument is a code word that will dictate how much the letters will shift one by one.  

DeCaesar:
	For this program, the same two types of arguments must be stated as in the Caesar program.  Except, in this program, the first argument must be the coded message.  The second argument is the number by which the original message was shifted to create the coded message. 

DeVigenere:
	For this program, the first argument should be the coded message from the Vigenere cipher.  The second argument typed in should be the code word used to encrypt the original message.

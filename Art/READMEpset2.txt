Sierpinski:
In order to utilize this program, you must have one input number, the recursive number.

This program was inspired by the Sierpinski triangle, the Deathly Hallows, and The Eye of Sauron.  So, all three are combined in this interesting pyramid.  There is only one input number needed, the recursive number.  I would reccommend a recursive number around 7 or higher for better effect.

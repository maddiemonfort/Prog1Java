New to Breakout:

A score, based on number of bricks hit, is displayed.  Lives are displayed as well, and when all lives are lost, the game will end on an end-game screen.  When the paddle hits the ball on the left or the right, the velocity of the ball will increase.  A pause button has also been implemented.  If you wish to pause the game, press "P", and "Q" will resume the game.  If you destroy all the bricks, the game will end on with a win-screen.  

Also displayed is a "level" at the top.  But it is slightly irrelevant, since there is only one level.
